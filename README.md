Intro
--------------
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo 
in the late 1980s. 

The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 
25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named 
pomodoros, the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after 
the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
